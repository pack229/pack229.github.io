I can‚Äôt believe the school year is right around the corner, I hope you‚Äôve all had a wonderful summer!

We thought it would be great to jump right into scouting and join the annual [Labor Day Family Camp Weekend at Camp Cheesebrough](https://scoutingevent.com/055-FamilyCampCSR).

* üóìÔ∏è Date: Friday, August 30 - Sunday, September 1
* üìç Location: Camp Cheesebrough, 26005 Hwy 9, Los Gatos, CA
* üíµ Cost: $70 per camper

We‚Äôll need to register by August 25. Please register/pay directly via the [website](https://scoutingevent.com/055-FamilyCampCSR). Please also add your family to [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17-_tOvmeSYTuumce2Mk-9PU-ohjQXNvCLDuPO_KcfQE/edit?usp=sharing) so we can coordinate as a Pack.

Chesebrough is situated in a majestic redwood forest and surrounded by a rich history born of the logging industry that will transport you and your family while still being a quick drive away. During the weekend you will experience a full camp program with program areas open for your families to enjoy including:

* Crafts
* Nature
* Archery
* Air-powered BB
* Climbing
* Metalwork
* Scout Skills
* Games
* & More

On top of this, the program will include a campfire, guided hikes, and ample time for recreation and relaxation!

This campout is an amazing opportunity to start our scouting year off with a bang and reconnect with families new and old! Please feel free to reach out should you have any questions.

Hope to see you all there!
