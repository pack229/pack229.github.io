Welcome back Scouts! We will be having our first pack meeting of the school year this Monday September 9th at 6:30 PM in the library.

We will be distributing the [Raingutter Regatta](/2024/08/25/raingutter-regatta/) kits and will work on the first advancement of the year: the Bobcat Adventure.

Scouts at HSS can wear Class A uniforms to school on pack meeting days!
