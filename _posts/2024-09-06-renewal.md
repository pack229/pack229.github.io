## Scouting Renewal

Renewal will be a little different this year. Previously the Pack would collect fees and renew as unit. Going forward we've been asked to encourage Scouts to renew directly with [Scouting.org](https://www.scouting.org). Since your expiration date depends on when you first signed up, please be on the look out for an email when it's time to renew.

## Pack Fees

* For new scouts there is also a pack fee of $120.
  * This covers basic awards, patches, neckerchief, Regatta kit, PWD car, etc.
* For returning scouts the fee drops to $100
* Due by 2nd pack meeting on 10/14

## Pack Fee Payment Methods

Please pay the [Pack Treasurer](/finances).
