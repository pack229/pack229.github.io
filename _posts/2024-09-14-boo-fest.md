## Important

Since this is an official BSA event, please make sure to have your [health forms](https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/HealthSafety/pdf/680-001_AB.pdf) filled out and remember to bring them with you as they are quite strict with these. There is also an optional [BB Device permission form](https://scoutingevent.com/Download/055131095/OR/2020CALIFORNIABBFormsimplified.pdf) to complete and bring should your Scout participate. *Please note Cub Scout Lions are not eligible to participate in shooting activities, however, they will be able to enjoy the archery range.* I recommend you keep copies of these forms for future events so you do not have to complete them again.
