If you are interested in fostering your scout's Catholic identity and faith, the [Religious Emblems](https://nccs-bsa.org/religious-emblems/) program is a great way to establish regular conversation on matters of faith and service. Upon completion of a parent-directed workbook, your scout will receive a religious emblem to pin to their uniform. They will receive this emblem at a Sunday, March 30th at 4:00 PM Catholic Scouting Prayer Service and Recognition Ceremony at the beautiful Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph in downtown San Jose.

* Email [Jeannie](mailto:jeanne.duax@gmail.com) by Monday, October 16, if you want your scout to participate in this program.
