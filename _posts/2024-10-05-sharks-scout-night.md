Please join us on Saturday, November 2nd at 7pm for the 2024 San Jose Sharks Scout Night! Itâ€™s sure to be a fun-filled night rooting on our hometown Sharks with your fellow Scouts as they take on the Vancouver Canucks! We will receive special pricing just for scouts when you purchase your tickets via [this link](https://fevo-enterprise.com/event/Scoutnight55). Our Scouts will also receive a patch and a post-game group photo on the ice.

Try to get tickets in Section 121 so we can sit closer together.
