Our Pack 229 (2024-2025) Class B shirt is ready for order! This shirt is a great way for our scouts (and parents) to show their Holy Spirit and Pack 229 pride. It offers a comfortable alternative to the official cub scout uniform. Order some for your whole family today!

The more shirts we order as a group, the better price we will get per shirt (~$12-$16 per shirt)

Contact [Mathias Jakob](mailto:mathias.jakob.de@googlemail.com) if you have any questions.
