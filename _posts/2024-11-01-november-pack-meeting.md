Just a quick reminder about our Pack Meeting on Monday November 4th at 6:30 PM in the library.

We’ll be reminiscing about recent activities, handing out awards, creating our [Christmas in the Park](/2024/11/03/christmas-in-the-park/) decorations, and preparing for the upcoming [Veteran’s Day assembly](/2024/11/02/veterans-day-assembly/).

Scouts at HSS can wear Class A uniforms to school on pack meeting days!

Also, please remember to bring any additional cans for our Scouting for Food drive. Your contributions make a difference!
