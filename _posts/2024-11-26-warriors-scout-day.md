It's almost time to purchase our tickets for the '24-'25 Golden State Warriors Scout Day when the Warriors take on the LA Clippers! As if watching our Warriors play wasnâ€™t enough, our Scouts will also receive a Scout Day Shirt and have the opportunity for post-game free-throws on the court!

We will receive special group pricing but we will need an approximate headcount in order to get our blocks of seats. The ticket range should be between $100-$200 per ticket, ticket prices will be confirmed sometime in December, at which time a link to purchase will also be sent out. Please add your family details to this [interest form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gA-W5oOWwnadd23mmMZNDeEWwrTVq5tP2ev2JB0aQWs/edit?usp=sharing) before December 8th, but note that you are not obligated to purchase based on interest.
