We are excited to invite you and your Scouts to participate in the Los Gatos Christmas Parade on the morning of Saturday, December 7th. This wonderful event has been a cherished tradition for our community, with the Dad’s Club proudly organizing and sponsoring our entry for several years.

This year, we’d love to have a few scouts join us to carry the Holy Spirit School banner in front of our float. It’s a fun and memorable experience, and we’d be so grateful for your help in making our pack shine!

__Commitment:__ Scouts and parents need to arrive early to line up with the float. The parade runs rain or shine.

__What to Wear:__ Class A uniforms are preferred for Scouts carrying the banner. Theme is Toy Story, so others can dress up as their favorite Toy Story characters.

If your Scout would like to participate, please [RSVP](https://forms.gle/5cjkWHaCec3bBXRp8).

Thank you for your support in representing Holy Spirit School and our amazing pack. We look forward to seeing you there!

Meet at 9:45 AM at [Spot 141](https://app.paradecloud.com/lineup/1146/737bf7ceade1abbe80c3d78d41638912). Parade starts at 11:00 AM.
