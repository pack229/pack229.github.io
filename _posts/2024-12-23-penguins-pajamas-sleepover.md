Experience our very own night at the museum at the California Academy of Sciences [Penguins+Pajamas](https://www.calacademy.org/penguinspajamas-sleepovers) Sleepover event! Explore the exhibits after-hours and discover the deepest depths of the oceans, travel to the tops of rainforests, blast off into outer space at your own private planetarium show, and then settle in for story time after snacking on milk and cookies.

When the lights go out, roll out your sleeping bag in one the museum’s iconic exhibits. Snooze next to the African Penguin colony, dream beside fish in the Philippine Coral Reef, or drift off in a world of color at Color of Life! In the morning, rise and shine, then head over to the Academy Café for breakfast — and continue your adventure with complimentary next-day admission to the museum.

We will each purchase our own tickets via the [event link](https://www.calacademy.org/buy-tickets/?type=sleepover#step=performance), but please include your family info on this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z4HHPp-EN9_rwDOcX51hv1RhQVxnEp3gHbMAAH71ZNQ/edit?usp=sharing) for Pack planning purposes.

After the Sleepover ends at 8:00 AM, the museum must be vacated to prepare for opening. Since next-day admission to the museum is included with your sleepover ticket, feel free to get your hand stamped and re-enter when the building opens to the public for the day.
