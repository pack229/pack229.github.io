If you are participating in the [Religious Emblems Program](/2024/09/28/religious-emblems/) please come to the [February Pack Meeting](/2025/01/13/february-pack-meeting/) 30 minutes early so we can review with Fr. Robert.

Paperwork needs to be submitted by 2/15 and the scouts will receive their awards from the Bishop in a ceremony at the Basilica on Sunday, March 30.
