At the [March Pack Meeting](/2025/03/04/march-pack-meeting/) we had a scavenger hunt to learn about:

  * The [History of Scouting](https://www.scout.org/who-we-are/scout-movement/scoutings-history)
  * The [6 Scout Knots](https://scoutingweb.com/boy-scout-knots/)
  * How to "[Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/)" when [Camping](/2025/01/19/spring-family-campout-date/)
  * How the 12 Points of the [Scout Law](https://www.scouting.org/about/faq/question10/) apply to the [Pinewood Derby](https://hsspack229.org/2025/03/05/pinewood-derby-check-in/)
