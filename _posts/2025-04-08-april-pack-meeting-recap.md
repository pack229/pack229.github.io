The scouts prepared for the [Spring Family Campout](/2025/01/19/spring-family-campout-date/) by:

* Learning about campfire safety
* Preparing a packing list including the [Six Cub Scout Essentials](https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2017/08/08/cub-scout-six-essentials-half-dozen-items-pack-every-campout-hike/)
* Suggesting meal plans
* Reviewing [Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org) guidelines
* Working on skits and songs for the campfire

Scouts also received patches for participating in the [Pinewood Derby](http://localhost:4000/2025/03/31/pindwood-derby-photos/)!
