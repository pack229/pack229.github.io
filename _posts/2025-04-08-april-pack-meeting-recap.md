The scouts prepared for the [Spring Family Campout](/2025/01/19/spring-family-campout-date/) by:

* Learning about campfire safety
* Preparing a packing list including the [Six Cub Scout Essentials](https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2017/08/08/cub-scout-six-essentials-half-dozen-items-pack-every-campout-hike/)
* Suggesting meal plans
* Reviewing [Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org) guidelines
* Working on skits and songs for the campfire

If you need to make a payment for a sibling Pinewood Derby car ($6.99) or the per-family cost for the Blue & Gold BBQ ($20) please see the [Finances](/finances) page.
