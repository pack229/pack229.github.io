As we wrap up another great year of Cub Scouting adventures, we’re excited to invite you and your families to our Spring 2025 Family Campout! This is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate our Scouts’ achievements, enjoy the outdoors, and make lasting memories together.

We’ll have fun activities, campfire stories and skits, and plenty of time to relax and connect with fellow Scout families. Whether you’re an experienced camper or trying it for the first time, this will be a fantastic way to close out the Scout year.

## A few helpful notes:

Can’t Camp Overnight? That’s okay! If overnight camping isn’t your thing, or your schedule doesn’t allow, please still come out on Saturday morning for a full day of activities. Stay as long as you like, then head home in the evening when you’re ready.
Packing List: Check out the packing list in the sign-up document. It covers all the essentials plus a few optional items to make your trip more comfortable. Pro tip: better to overpack than underpack — especially when it comes to clothes and bedding.
Uniforms: Scouts should wear their Class A uniforms for breakfast, flags, and dinner. Class B shirts can be worn at all other times.
Tent Setup: If you’re a little rusty on tent setup or it’s your very first time, aim to arrive well before dark - don’t hesitate to ask for help. There are always experienced campers ready to lend a hand.
Event Schedule: The campout agenda is available in the sign-up document as well. It’ll give you a sense of how the weekend flows. Keep in mind, we may adjust activities here and there.
Volunteer Opportunities: Meal prep, cleanup, and activity support are great chances to meet other families and leaders. Don’t worry if you’re not a master chef — we’ll guide you through everything.
Saturday Night Campfire: This is one of the highlights of the weekend. We’ll gather for songs, den skits, a campfire story or two, and of course, roast marshmallows and make s’mores. It’s a great way to wind down together as a Pack.

## Medical Forms

One of the annual participation requirements is the Health and Medical Record [INSERT]. This form must be completed for ALL ATTENDEES of the Campout (including non-scout siblings, parents, and other family members). Please include a copy of both sides of your medical insurance card. Please turn in your completed form and copies of the insurance card in a sealed envelope with your family name printed on the outside upon arrival. Envelopes will only be opened in case of emergency for privacy reasons.
