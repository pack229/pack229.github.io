As we wrap up another great year of Cub Scouting adventures, we’re excited to invite you and your families to our **Spring 2025 Family Campout!** This is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate our Scouts’ achievements, enjoy the outdoors, and make lasting memories together.

We’ll have fun activities, campfire stories and skits, and plenty of time to relax and connect with fellow Scout families. Whether you’re an experienced camper or trying it for the first time, this will be a fantastic way to close out the Scout year.

[**Volunteer Opportunities**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FMami4VNW2xzJjRfHGjgOkjvJO8XHdUO7btt8pPgxW8/edit?gid=961583990#gid=961583990): Meal prep, cleanup, and activity support are great chances to meet other families and leaders. Don’t worry if you’re not a master chef — we’ll guide you through everything.

**Saturday Night Campfire**: This is one of the highlights of the weekend. We’ll gather for songs, den skits, a campfire story or two, and of course, roast marshmallows and make s’mores. It’s a great way to wind down together as a Pack.

## FAQs

Questions? We've got answers!

Whether you're a first-time camper or a seasoned pro, camping with your Cub Scout family is a fun and memorable experience. Below are some general FAQs to help guide you through what to expect and how to prepare for a successful Cub Scout family camping trip.

##### How does arrival work?
When arriving at the Park please check in with the entry gate. Tell them that you are with "Pack 229 / Eduardo Cortez".

##### Can I attend if my family can't camp overnight?
Yes, absolutely! If overnight camping isn't for you, feel free to come on Saturday morning for a full day of activities. You can stay as long as you like and head home when you're ready.

##### Is it ok for parents to leave and come back?
No, one parent needs to be onsite with their scout at all times.

##### What if I’ve never camped before?
No problem! This campout is designed to be family-friendly and fun for all experience levels. If you're unsure about something, don't hesitate to ask for help—our experienced campers are always happy to assist.

##### Is there a packing list?
Yes, please see the [packing list](/docs/family-campout/packing-list). We recommend overpacking slightly, especially when it comes to clothes and bedding, just in case. The weather can be unpredictable, so it’s always best to be prepared.

##### Do I need to buy equipment?
You will need to provide most of your own equipment, but if you are in need of something, please reach out on the What's App to see if others have extras you can borrow.

##### Will there be parking?
Yes, but plan to bring a wagon to help get your equipment to the campsite.

#### Uniforms & Tent Setup

##### What should my Scout wear?
Scouts should wear their Class A uniforms for breakfast, flag ceremonies, and dinner. Class B shirts can be worn during the rest of the activities.

##### Do I need my own tent?
Yes, please refer to [packing list](/docs/family-campout/packing-list).

##### I’m new to tent camping. Any tips for setup?
We recommend arriving as close to 5:00 as possible, especially if you're new to tent setup. Don’t hesitate to ask fellow campers for help—there will be plenty of experienced families ready to lend a hand.

#### Event Schedule & Activities

##### What’s the schedule for the weekend?
See the [campout agenda](/docs/family-campout/agenda). It gives a general overview of the weekend, but keep in mind that we may adjust activities based on weather or timing. There will be a mix of organized activities, downtime, and family fun.

##### Will there be activities for siblings?
Yes! The activities are designed for all ages, and siblings are welcome to participate in most of them. This is a great opportunity for the whole family to enjoy the outdoors together.

##### Will there be opportunities to fish?
Yes, there are 2 lakes nearby. You will need to bring your own equipment. Youth don't need a fishing license but adults do if they are going to be fishing or helping out. You can learn more about fishing licences at the [Fish and Wildlife Website](https://wildlife.ca.gov/licenseapp).

##### What’s the Saturday Night Campfire like?
The campfire is a highlight! We’ll gather for songs, den skits, a couple of campfire stories, and of course, roast marshmallows and make s’mores. It’s a fun and cozy way to close out the day.

#### Meals & Food

<a name="bring-a-cup"></a>

##### What meals will be provided?
Dinner on Friday night will be BYOD (bring your own dinner, picnic or bag style, no cooking). The Pack will provide breakfast on Saturday and Sunday, as well as lunch and dinner on Saturday. Please indicate any dietary restrictions on the signup sheet.

##### Should I bring any plates or cups?
In an effort to minimize waste, please bring a cup for each of your family members. The cup will be used throughout the weekend for water, coffee, Kool-aid, etc. Make sure to label it with your name! Paper plates, napkins and plastic utensils will be provided for meals.

##### Can I bring my own food?
While meals will be provided, with the exception of Friday night BYOD, if you have specific dietary needs or preferences, you are welcome to bring your own snacks or food. Please do not leave candy or other food in tents. This will attract unwanted attention from various animals around camp. We recommend labeling your personal items to avoid confusion with group supplies.

##### What if I have food allergies or dietary restrictions?
Be sure to note any food allergies or dietary restrictions in the sign-up form or communicate with the event coordinator in advance. The event leaders will do their best to accommodate these needs.

#### Volunteering & Help

##### How can I volunteer to help?
There are several volunteer opportunities available including meal prep, clean-up, and helping with activities. These are great chances to meet other families and make the event even more fun. Don’t worry if you’re not a pro at cooking or camp activities—we’ll guide you every step of the way! Please check out the Volunteer Signup tab of this document for opportunities.

<a name="medical-forms"></a>

#### Medical Forms

##### Do I need a medical form?
Yes, all attendees (including parents, siblings, and other family members) are required to complete a [Health and Medical Record form](https://www.scouting.org/health-and-safety/ahmr/) for "weekend camping trips less than 72 hours in duration". Please also include a copy of your insurance card with both sides visible. Turn in the completed forms in a sealed envelope with your family name printed on the outside when you arrive. The envelopes will only be opened in case of an emergency for privacy.

#### Additional Information

##### Will there be restrooms and showers at the campsite?
Yes, Ed R. Levin County Park has restroom facilities. Showers may be limited, so please plan accordingly.

##### What should I do if I have a question or need assistance during the event?
Look for Pack 229 leaders in identifiable attire (like t-shirts or hats). Our team will be happy to assist you throughout the weekend.

##### What should I do if it rains or the weather is bad?
Always be prepared for different weather conditions. Bring rain gear (ponchos, waterproof boots), and plan for covered areas if needed.

###### How do I keep my family comfortable while camping?
Comfort is key, especially if it’s your first time camping. Make sure to bring plenty of layers for warmth, especially in the evenings. A good-quality sleeping bag, comfortable sleeping pad, and a pillow can make a huge difference in your camping experience.

##### Some Rules

 * Closed-toe shoes should be worn during activities as appropriate.
 * No Stick Fighting
 * Report safety issues to the Cubmaster immediately.
 * Please place all trash in garbage cans.
 * No alcohol. Those adults choosing not to respect this rule associated with Cub Scout events will be asked to leave.
