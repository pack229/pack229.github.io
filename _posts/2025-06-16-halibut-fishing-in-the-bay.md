We’re excited to invite you to a halibut fishing adventure in the Bay on July 3rd! We're planning a half-day morning trip (exact time TBD) aboard the Oakland Anglers II, and it’s going to be a fun, family-friendly outing on the water. No Fishing Experience Needed! Never fished before? No problem at all! Fishing poles are included!

### What to Expect

The boat stays within the Bay, where waters are typically calm. You’ll enjoy amazing views of Alcatraz, the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges, and the surrounding cities — all while having a blast with fellow Pack families. Just show up, stand there, talk, laugh, and enjoy the day. The amazing deckhands will:

 * Set up your pole
 * Bait your hook
 * Coach you on reeling in your catch
 * Handle the fish (including the "splashy" parts if the kids prefer not to!)
 * And get you back in action for your next one

#### Additional costs to plan for:
 
 * ~$10 for live bait and tackle
 * $20 (optional) for fish filleting/cleaning
 * Gratuity for the crew
 * Food available for purchase onboard

We hope you can join us for this special outing! Let us know if you have any questions!
