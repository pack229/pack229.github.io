Hope everyone is having a great summer! The SJ Giants Scout Night and Overnight is coming up on Saturday, July 19th @ 5PM. We had a great time as a Pack sitting together last year!

Enjoy a pregame parade and post-game opportunity for your scout to run the bases. Then camp out after the game in the very same outfield the Giants just played on. The night finishes with a movie on the 36' HD video board (last year it was Angels in the Outfield). The fun doesn't end there though as scouts receive a light breakfast in the morning and a special San Jose Giants Scout Night Commemorative Patch.

### There are a few options to choose from:

 * You can attend the game only for $15 per ticket (Only Sections E/F/G are available at this time). This does not include food. (I'm unable to add the bbq package to a game only ticket. Sorry!).
 * You can attend the game and stay overnight for $30 per person (youth/adults are the same price). This does not include food.
 * You can attend the game and stay overnight AND get a ticket for BBQ and a drink. $45 per child. $60 per adult.

Please Sign Up and Venmo Neschae by EOD Thursday, July 10th. We'll be contacting the box office on Friday to reserve our seats for the first round. If seats are still available, I'll plan to reach out to them next Tuesday as well.
