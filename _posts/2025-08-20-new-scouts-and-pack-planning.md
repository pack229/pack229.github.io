# New Parent Info Night

We are beginning to form new dens for the 2025-2026 school year. Come learn more about Pack 229 and how you can get involved in the 2025-26 Scouting Year.

Please forward to anyone with boys or girls ages K-5 interested in joining.

# Pack Planning Meeting

As we gear up for an exciting year ahead filled with fun, learning, and adventure, we invite you all to our upcoming Cub Scout Pack Planning Meeting. Your participation and input are invaluable as we finalize our plans for the year and create an unforgettable experience for our scouts.

Your involvement plays a vital role in shaping the scouting journey for our children in the upcoming year. If you are unable to attend the meeting but still want to contribute your thoughts or express interest in volunteering, please don't hesitate to [let us know](mailto:neschae@gmail.com,djd@davisca.org).

Let's work together to make this scouting year a memorable and enriching experience for all our Cubs. Your ideas and enthusiasm are what make our Pack thrive!
