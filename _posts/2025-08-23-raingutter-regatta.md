It’s time to get out the paint and glue and put on your creative caps for our annual Raingutter Regatta! We'll be starting to build our boats at the [September Pack Meeting](/2025/08/23/september-pack-meeting). If you are unable to make the meeting please [reach out](mailto:djd@davisca.org) to get your regatta boat kit.

Siblings are welcome! We kindly request a $7 donation to cover the cost of the kit and awards for non Scouts.

*Boat Building:* Before the races begin, put on your creative cap and assemble your very own mini sailboat. This hands-on experience encourages problem-solving and craftsmanship. Please come up with a name and [Register Your Boat](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ix35xz7fsz3cHJHEt-JiUOZeCQWC5irCgyjvpKwJzk/edit?usp=sharing) before the event.

*Race Day Excitement:* Watch as your handcrafted sailboat takes to the water in friendly competition! Blow on the sails and navigate your vessel along the rain gutter racetrack. It's a test of precision and strategy.

*Refreshments:* Enjoy a Pizza lunch as you mingle with other Scouts and families. It's a great time to share stories and build connections.

*What to Bring:* Please bring your boat, a sense of adventure, and a willingness to have a blast!

*Friendly Competition:* Compete against fellow Cub Scouts, families, and friends. Cheering, encouragement, and sportsmanship are all part of the fun.

*Awards & Prizes:* Celebrate the winners and recognize the effort and creativity that went into boat design. Prizes will be awarded to the top sailors and there will also be awards for best design.

*Rules:* Please review the [Raingutter Regatta Rules](/docs/raingutter-regatta/rules).

Don't miss this opportunity for your Cub Scout to learn about teamwork, craftsmanship, and the joy of friendly competition. The Cub Scout Raingutter Regatta is a family-friendly event that combines fun and learning in a unique and exciting way.

Whether you're a seasoned sailor or a first-time boat builder, this event promises memorable moments and a sense of accomplishment.

Can’t wait to see you all out there!
