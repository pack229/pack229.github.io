Welcome back Scouts! We will be having our first pack meeting of the school year on Monday September 8th at 6:30 PM in the library.

The Arrow of Light scouts will be our first [service den](/docs/service-den) for this meeting.

We'll start the meeting with a [uniform inspection](/docs/uniforms) for the new scouting year and discussing the Bobcat rank requirements.

We will be distributing the [Raingutter Regatta](/2025/08/23/raingutter-regatta/) boat kits and starting to work on them in dens. Scouts will need to finish painting and decorating their boats at home after the meeting. If you are unable to make the meeting please [reach out](mailto:djd@davisca.org) to get your regatta boat kit.

Finally, we will work on the first advancement of the year: the Bobcat Adventure.

Scouts at HSS can wear Class A uniforms to school on pack meeting days!
