Scouting for Food is an ongoing annual program of the Boy Scouts of America, begun in 1985 by the Greater Saint Louis Area Council. The program involves collecting for local food banks. It is organized at the local level throughout the country. Scouting for Food is a project rooted in the very foundation of the Scouting movement and its dedication to implement the Scout Slogan and do a good turn daily.

This year we will be collecting for Sacred Heart Community Center.

## Door Hangers

We handed out door hangers at the October Pack meeting. Please get in touch if you need more.

## Neighborhood Pickup

Then on Saturday November 15th at 9:00 AM you'll return to collect any donations that are left out.

## Food Drop Off

* At the Holy Spirit Courtyard by the Church on Sunday, November 16th from 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM.

Please reach out to this year's organizer [Rosanna Gamez](mailto:rosannamgamez@gmail.com) if you can't make any of these times.
