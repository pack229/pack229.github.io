Cub Scouts is for boys and girls, kindergarten to 5th grade. It is a program where youth develop the foundations for leadership, citizenship, and personal fitness through fun activities. Dens are organized by grade. [Cub Scouting](https://www.scouting.org/programs/) activities are designed for Scouting families to get in on the fun, and include exploring the outdoors, building projects, making friends, and developing a lifelong love of learning as Cub Scouts earn patches related to their grades.

Pack 229 meets at [Holy Spirit School](https://www.holyspirit-school.org) in San Jose, CA and is a part of the [Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council](https://svmbc.org/) of [Scouting America](https://www.scouting.org). We welcome students from Holy Spirit School or [Parish](https://holyspiritchurch.org) and other surrounding schools.
