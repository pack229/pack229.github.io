### 1. Participation

* Eligibility: All registered Cub Scouts and siblings are eligible to participate.
* Age Groups: Scouts will be divided into rank / age groups based on the number of participants.

### 2. Boat Specifications

* Kit Requirement: Boats must be built using the official BSA Raingutter Regatta kit.
* Materials: The boat must be constructed from the materials provided in the kit. No additional parts may be added except for decorations (paint, decals, figurines, etc.) Glue is advisable to connect sail to mast
* Sail: The sail should 'look' like a sail and in the orientation on the kit.
* No creating cups or special sail orientations.

### 3. Race Rules

* Power Source: Boats can only be powered by blowing on the sail. Scouts may blow on their boats using straws or directly, but they cannot touch the boat once the race begins.
* Blowing Style: No fans or other mechanical aids are allowed. The scout must move the boat by blowing air on the sail.
* Starting Position: Boats should be placed at the starting line, fully behind the gutter's edge. Scouts must stand at the head of their raingutter.
* Finish Line: The boat that crosses the finish line first wins the race. A boat must fully cross the line to be declared the winner.
* Judges: Race officials will be positioned at the finish line to determine the winner of each heat.

### 4. Sportsmanship

* Respect and Fair Play: Scouts should exhibit good sportsmanship by supporting fellow participants and accepting the outcome of each race graciously.
* Disqualification: Any scout found intentionally interfering with another scoutâ€™s boat, altering their boat outside the rules, or displaying unsportsmanlike behavior may be disqualified.

### 5. Awards

* We will have awards for winners for each race category and also a design award.
