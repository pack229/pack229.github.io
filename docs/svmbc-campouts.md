Fellow Pack 229 Boo Fest Campers,

Looks like they sent out the updated schedule. I'm sure your scout will have a lot of memorable experiences from the event.

Some comments:
1. Keep copies of your health forms (A / B). They are quite strict about these and will ask for them upon arrival. They are long and a pain to fill, but these are the same forms you will need for all camp outs.
2. It's a little bit of a walk from the car drop off to the camping site, so if your gear is heavy you may want to use a wagon. (I'll be bringing mine, if you'd like to borrow).
3. Weather looks good but the mornings / nights can get quite chilly
4. Little to no cell reception at the campout
5. Bring your uniforms and costumes.

Let me know if you have any questions. Look forward to a fun campout!
