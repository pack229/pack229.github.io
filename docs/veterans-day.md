@Mike, yes it will be great to have Joey or someone you think would be interested and who could do justice for the group (Damian, did a nice job last year). Here are a couple of additional items and food for thought.   Let's plan to connect and tie up any loose ends tonight.

To Do
1. Find Girlscout troops and inform them to do a poem (Older girls?) - Optional
2.  Invite Middle School Scouts to come in uniforms (Jean / Jenn Turner - 290, Michelle Layton /  Michael Phelps - 286)
3. Identify who is the MC and handover between Mrs. Douhit / La Cuesta
@Lauren, do you have visibility of who will be driving from the admin side?
4. Identify Scout Leader to lead procession (Joey OR WB)?

Proposed Sequence (we'll have to work with owners)
1. Line up with space for scouts to process through - (Admin leader)
2. Scout Leader starts the procession - (Scout Leader)
3. Invite and introduce any veterans to the the stage - (Scout Leader)
4. Say the blessing (Mrs Douhit did a nice job last year) - (Admin leader)
5. Introduce our speaker - (Admin leader)
6. Speaker speaks (Speaker)
7. Girl scouts can say a poem for our Veterans they did a nice job in the past (Maybe 7 can come after 4)
8. Continue for Flag dismissal (Scout Leader)
