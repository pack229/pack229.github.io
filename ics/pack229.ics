DESCRIPTION:https://hsspack229.org/2024/10/02/crabbing\n\nSpace is limited 
 to 16 crabbers so sign up soon!\n\n\n * Since space is limited\, the exper
 ience is currently open to Cub Scouts and their siblings in our pack. (For
  the Lions and Tigers\, we need a 1:1 ratio of adults and kids.)\n * The e
 vent happens on land near the shore\, so there is no boat involved.\n * Eq
 uipment will be provided by Alex who is an expert crabber. But bring your 
 bucket so you can take home your crabs to cook and eat for dinner.\n * We 
 will need a minimum of 6 crabbing participants\, with 16 being the max.\n 
 * Parent Chaperones will not have to pay if they share a pole with a child
  or are not participating.\n\n\nMore information from our crabber\, Alex
 …\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWe will meet at a pier in the Marina/Presidio dist
 rict of San Francisco where we will be located near the Golden Gate Bridge
 . The views of the water will be spectacular and because of the size of th
 e pier we will have more than enough room to spread out and try our techni
 ques. Make sure to arrive early so you can find parking and pay for it if 
 need be near The Warming Hut cafe. The best place to park is in the public
  parking lot next to The Warming Hut Cafe by way of Mason street. Don’t 
 take Long Ave as it will lead to the other side of the parking lot and par
 king is scarce on that side.\n\n\nOnce all the guests have arrived we will
  learn to set up the equipment we will supply with a very detailed explana
 tion of how and why we use particular gear. Once we have set up our rods\,
  filled our bait in our traps we will learn the different forms of casting
  and the technique of reeling. Because we are fishing for crab there is a 
 different approach to how you catch crab off of a rod and reel.\n\n\nWe wi
 ll be catching rock &amp\; red crab which are edible and delicious crabs t
 o take home. This experience is an all weather endeavor so rain or shine w
 e will make it happen.\n\n\nPlease add your name to the list\, even if the
 re are already 16 participants and we will try to open up another session.
