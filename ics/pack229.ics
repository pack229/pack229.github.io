 \nA few helpful notes:\n\nCan‚Äôt Camp Overnight? That‚Äôs okay! If overni
 ght camping isn‚Äôt your thing\, or your schedule doesn‚Äôt allow\, please
  still come out on Saturday morning for a full day of activities. Stay as 
 long as you like\, then head home in the evening when you‚Äôre ready.\nPac
 king List: Check out the packing list in the sign-up document. It covers a
 ll the essentials plus a few optional items to make your trip more comfort
 able. Pro tip: better to overpack than underpack ‚Äî especially when it co
 mes to clothes and bedding.\nUniforms: Scouts should wear their Class A un
 iforms for breakfast\, flags\, and dinner. Class B shirts can be worn at a
 ll other times.\nTent Setup: If you‚Äôre a little rusty on tent setup or i
 t‚Äôs your very first time\, aim to arrive well before dark - don‚Äôt hesi
 tate to ask for help. There are always experienced campers ready to lend a
  hand.\nEvent Schedule: The campout agenda is available in the sign-up doc
 ument as well. It‚Äôll give you a sense of how the weekend flows. Keep in 
 mind\, we may adjust activities here and there.\nVolunteer Opportunities: 
 Meal prep\, cleanup\, and activity support are great chances to meet other
  families and leaders. Don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre not a master chef ‚Äî we
 ‚Äôll guide you through everything.\nSaturday Night Campfire: This is one 
 of the highlights of the weekend. We‚Äôll gather for songs\, den skits\, a
  campfire story or two\, and of course\, roast marshmallows and make s‚Äôm
 ores. It‚Äôs a great way to wind down together as a Pack.\n\nMedical Forms
