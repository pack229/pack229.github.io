DESCRIPTION:Space is limited to 16 crabbers so sign up soon!\n\n\n * Since 
 space is limited\, the experience is currently open to Cub Scouts and thei
 r siblings in our pack. (For the Lions and Tigers\, we need a 1:1 ratio of
  adults and kids.)\n * The event happens on land near the shore\, so there
  is no boat involved.\n * Equipment will be provided by Alex who is an exp
 ert crabber. But bring your bucket so you can take home your crabs to cook
  and eat for dinner.\n * We will need a minimum of 6 crabbing participants
 \, with 16 being the max.\n * Parent Chaperones will not have to pay if th
 ey share a pole with a child or are not participating.\n\n\nMore informati
 on from our crabber\, Alex…\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWe will meet at a pier i
 n the Marina/Presidio district of San Francisco where we will be located n
 ear the Golden Gate Bridge. The views of the water will be spectacular and
  because of the size of the pier we will have more than enough room to spr
 ead out and try our techniques. Make sure to arrive early so you can find 
 parking and pay for it if need be near The Warming Hut cafe. The best plac
 e to park is in the public parking lot next to The Warming Hut Cafe by way
  of Mason street. Don’t take Long Ave as it will lead to the other side 
 of the parking lot and parking is scarce on that side.\n\n\nOnce all the g
 uests have arrived we will learn to set up the equipment we will supply wi
 th a very detailed explanation of how and why we use particular gear. Once
  we have set up our rods\, filled our bait in our traps we will learn the 
 different forms of casting and the technique of reeling. Because we are fi
 shing for crab there is a different approach to how you catch crab off of 
 a rod and reel.\n\n\nWe will be catching rock &amp\; red crab which are ed
 ible and delicious crabs to take home. This experience is an all weather e
 ndeavor so rain or shine we will make it happen.\n\n\nPlease add your name
  to the list\, even if there are already 16 participants and we will try t
 o open up another session.\n\n
