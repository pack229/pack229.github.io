DESCRIPTION:https://hsspack229.org/2024/10/02/crabbing\n\nSpace is limited 
 to 16 crabbers so sign up soon!\n\n * Since space is limited\, the experie
 nce is currently open to Cub Scouts and their siblings in our pack. (For t
 he Lions and Tigers\, we need a 1:1 ratio of adults and kids.)\n * The eve
 nt happens on land near the shore\, so there is no boat involved.\n * Equi
 pment will be provided by Alex who is an expert crabber. But bring your bu
 cket so you can take home your crabs to cook and eat for dinner.\n * We wi
 ll need a minimum of 6 crabbing participants\, with 16 being the max.\n * 
 Parent Chaperones will not have to pay if they share a pole with a child o
 r are not participating.\n\nMore information from our crabber\, Alex…\n\
 n<!--more-->\n\nWe will meet at a pier in the Marina/Presidio district of 
 San Francisco where we will be located near the Golden Gate Bridge. The vi
 ews of the water will be spectacular and because of the size of the pier w
 e will have more than enough room to spread out and try our techniques. Ma
 ke sure to arrive early so you can find parking and pay for it if need be 
 near The Warming Hut cafe. The best place to park is in the public parking
  lot next to The Warming Hut Cafe by way of Mason street. Don’t take Lon
 g Ave as it will lead to the other side of the parking lot and parking is 
 scarce on that side.\n\nOnce all the guests have arrived we will learn to 
 set up the equipment we will supply with a very detailed explanation of ho
 w and why we use particular gear. Once we have set up our rods\, filled ou
 r bait in our traps we will learn the different forms of casting and the t
 echnique of reeling. Because we are fishing for crab there is a different 
 approach to how you catch crab off of a rod and reel.\n\nWe will be catchi
 ng rock &amp\; red crab which are edible and delicious crabs to take home.
  This experience is an all weather endeavor so rain or shine we will make 
 it happen.\n\nPlease add your name to the list\, even if there are already
  16 participants and we will try to open up another session.\n\n
