 9th 2024\n\nSpace is limited to 16 crabbers so sign up soon!\n\n * Since s
 pace is limited\, the experience is currently open to Cub Scouts and their
  siblings in our pack. (For the Lions and Tigers\, we need a 1:1 ratio of 
 adults and kids.)\n * The event happens on land near the shore\, so there 
 is no boat involved.\n * Equipment will be provided by Alex who is an expe
 rt crabber. But bring your bucket so you can take home your crabs to cook 
 and eat for dinner.\n * We will need a minimum of 6 crabbing participants\
 , with 16 being the max.\n * Parent Chaperones will not have to pay if the
 y share a pole with a child or are not participating.\n\nMore information 
 from our crabber\, Alex‚Ä¶\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWe will meet at a pier in the
  Marina/Presidio district of San Francisco where we will be located near t
 he Golden Gate Bridge. The views of the water will be spectacular and beca
 use of the size of the pier we will have more than enough room to spread o
 ut and try our techniques. Make sure to arrive early so you can find parki
 ng and pay for it if need be near The Warming Hut cafe. The best place to 
 park is in the public parking lot next to The Warming Hut Cafe by way of M
 ason street. Don‚Äôt take Long Ave as it will lead to the other side of th
 e parking lot and parking is scarce on that side.\n\nOnce all the guests h
 ave arrived we will learn to set up the equipment we will supply with a ve
 ry detailed explanation of how and why we use particular gear. Once we hav
 e set up our rods\, filled our bait in our traps we will learn the differe
 nt forms of casting and the technique of reeling. Because we are fishing f
 or crab there is a different approach to how you catch crab off of a rod a
 nd reel.\n\nWe will be catching rock &amp\; red crab which are edible and 
 delicious crabs to take home. This experience is an all weather endeavor s
 o rain or shine we will make it happen.\n\nPlease add your name to the lis
 t\, even if there are already 16 participants and we will try to open up a
 nother session.\n\n[Link #1] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zi77y
