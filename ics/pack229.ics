DESCRIPTION:<p>Space is limited to 16 crabbers so sign up soon!</p>\n\n<ul>
 \n  <li>Parent Chaperones will not have to pay if they share a pole with a
  child or are not participating.</li>\n  <li>We will need a minimum of 6 c
 rabbing participants\, with 16 being the max.</li>\n  <li>Equipment will b
 e provided by Alex who is an expert crabber. But bring your bucket so you 
 can take home your crabs to cook and eat for dinner.</li>\n  <li>The event
  happens on land near the shore\, so there is no boat involved.</li>\n  <l
 i>Since space is limited\, the experience is currently open to Cub Scouts 
 and their siblings in our pack. (For the Lions and Tigers\, we need a 1:1 
 ratio of adults and kids.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More information from our cra
 bber\, Alex…</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>We will meet at a pier in the Mari
 na/Presidio district of San Francisco where we will be located near the Go
 lden Gate Bridge. The views of the water will be spectacular and because o
 f the size of the pier we will have more than enough room to spread out an
 d try our techniques. Make sure to arrive early so you can find parking an
 d pay for it if need be near The Warming Hut cafe. The best place to park 
 is in the public parking lot next to The Warming Hut Cafe by way of Mason 
 street. Don’t take Long Ave as it will lead to the other side of the par
 king lot and parking is scarce on that side.</p>\n\n<p>Once all the guests
  have arrived we will learn to set up the equipment we will supply with a 
 very detailed explanation of how and why we use particular gear. Once we h
 ave set up our rods\, filled our bait in our traps we will learn the diffe
 rent forms of casting and the technique of reeling. Because we are fishing
  for crab there is a different approach to how you catch crab off of a rod
  and reel.</p>\n\n<p>We will be catching rock &amp\; red crab which are ed
 ible and delicious crabs to take home. This experience is an all weather e
 ndeavor so rain or shine we will make it happen.</p>\n\n<p>Please add your
  name to the list\, even if there are already 16 participants and we will 
 try to open up another session.</p>\n
