### Renew with Scouting America

Each year you need to renew with Scouting America. Look for a email from `Scouting America <noreply@scouting.org>` or log into your [MyScouting Account](https://my.scouting.org).

This fee goes to Scouting America and supports programs for all troops and packs.

### Pack Fees

The pack fee is $120 for all renewing scouts. This directly supports pack activities like the Regatta Regatta, Blue and Gold BBQ, and Pinewood Derby. Please see the [Finances page](/finances) for options how to pay and reach out to the [Troop Treasurer](/finances) with any questions.
